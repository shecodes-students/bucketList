# bucketList
a list of things to talk about in our sessions. to be updated whenever inspiration or desperation strikes.

* how to use a stream as the input to a function? (for my text extraction thing)
* in node, what is a wrapper?
* how to read someone else's code?
* can we talk about MVC a bit?
* where to start a project in which you only have the final result but you are totally oblivious about where to start and how it can be structured?
* what is Maven and a Maven artifact?
